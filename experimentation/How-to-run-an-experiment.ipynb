    "  - This is a great initial metric to track in this scenario because we're changing something specific on the homepage/search page. The aim is to encourage people to click on a restaurant to explore more, instead of being deterred by a long delivery time. Therefore, tracking the CTR would help evaluate if the implementation of a more optimal, ML-predicted delivery time results in an increased percentage of users clicking on the restaurants.\n",
    "- <b>Conversion Rate</b>: `Number of orders/Number of Clicks`\n",
    "  - Once a user has clicked on a restaurant, the ultimate goal is for them to finalize and order their food items. Therefore, this is the correct metric for measuring how successfully we've managed to turn app visitors into customers. It could help us gauge whether displaying an optimized delivery time using an ML model results in more orders placed, thereby improving the conversion rate.\n",
